# Deployment Guide

This document provides detailed information about the deployment process for the Sploosh AI Hockey Analytics application.

## Quick Reference - Available Scripts

All commands are run from the project root using npm:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run docker:up` | **‚≠ê Start development Docker containers (recommended)** |
| `npm run docker:build` | Build and start development containers (no cache) |
| `npm run docker:prod:up` | Start production Docker containers |
| `npm run docker:prod:build` | Build and start production containers (no cache) |
| `npm run dev` | Start development server (without Docker) |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm start` | Start production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run linter |
| `npm test` | Run all workflow tests |
| `npm run ghcr:build` | Build image for GitHub Container Registry |

**Recommended:** Use Docker for development (`npm run docker:up`) to ensure environment consistency.

See the [Build and Deployment](#build-and-deployment) section for complete command details.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview

Our application uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The main workflows are:

1. **semantic-pr-check.yml**: Validates PR titles follow semantic versioning format
2. **pr-build-check.yml**: Runs build checks on pull requests
3. **main-merge.yml**: Automatically bumps version and creates version bump PRs when changes are merged to main
4. **cleanup_ghcr.yml**: Cleans up old container images from GitHub Container Registry

## Semantic Versioning

The project follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **Major version** (X.0.0): Breaking changes - triggered by PR titles starting with `feat!:`
- **Minor version** (0.X.0): New features - triggered by PR titles starting with `feat:`
- **Patch version** (0.0.X): Bug fixes and maintenance - triggered by PR titles starting with `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, or `revert:`

## Version Bump Process

When a PR is merged to main:

1. The `main-merge.yml` workflow automatically determines the version bump type based on the PR title
2. A new branch is created with the version bump changes
3. A PR is automatically created with the version updates
4. Once checks pass, the version bump PR is automatically merged
5. The temporary branch is cleaned up

## PR Title Requirements

All PR titles must follow the semantic versioning format to pass CI checks:

- Must start with one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`
- Can include `!` for breaking changes (e.g., `feat!: breaking change`)
- Must be followed by a colon and description
- Examples:
  - `feat: add player statistics visualization`
  - `fix: correct animation timing issue`
  - `feat!: change API response format`

## Build and Deployment

The application is built using Next.js and can be deployed using various methods.

### Docker Development (Recommended)

**Docker is the preferred development environment** as it ensures consistency across all development machines and matches the production environment.

The project includes Docker configurations for both development and production:

#### Development Docker

```bash
# Start development containers
npm run docker:up

# Start in detached mode
npm run docker:up:detach

# Build and start (no cache)
npm run docker:build

# Stop and remove containers
npm run docker:down
```

#### Production Docker

```bash
# Start production containers
npm run docker:prod:up

# Start in detached mode
npm run docker:prod:up:detach

# Build and start (no cache)
npm run docker:prod:build

# Stop and remove containers
npm run docker:prod:down
```

### Local Development (Alternative)

If you need to run the application without Docker:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Upgrade Next.js to latest version
npm run upgrade:nextjs
```

**Note:** Docker is the recommended approach for development to ensure environment consistency.

### GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

For building and pushing images to GHCR:

```bash
# Build Docker image for GHCR
npm run ghcr:build

# Push to GHCR
npm run ghcr:push

# Test GHCR cleanup workflow
npm run ghcr:test
```

## Testing Workflows Locally

You can test GitHub Actions workflows locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

### Run All Workflow Tests

```bash
# Run all workflow tests
npm test
# or
npm run test:workflows
```

### Test Individual Workflows

#### Semantic PR Check

```bash
# Test with minor version bump
npm run test:workflows:semantic:minor

# Test with major version bump
npm run test:workflows:semantic:major

# Test with patch version bump
npm run test:workflows:semantic:patch

# Test with invalid PR title
npm run test:workflows:semantic:invalid
```

#### Version Bump and Merge

```bash
# Test version bump workflow
npm run test:workflows:version

# Test main merge workflow
npm run test:workflows:merge
```

#### GHCR Cleanup

```bash
# Test GHCR cleanup (dry run)
npm run test:workflows:ghcr

# Test with keep-versions strategy
npm run test:workflows:ghcr:keep-versions

# Test with keep-days strategy
npm run test:workflows:ghcr:keep-days

# Test actual cleanup
npm run test:workflows:ghcr:cleanup
```

## Vercel Integration

The project is configured to deploy preview builds to Vercel for each PR:

- Preview deployments are automatically created for each PR
- The `semantic-pr-check.yml` workflow waits for Vercel deployment to complete
- Preview URLs are available in the PR checks

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. **Build Failures**: Check the workflow logs in the GitHub Actions tab
2. **Version Bump Issues**: Ensure PR titles follow the semantic versioning format
3. **Vercel Deployment Issues**: Check the Vercel dashboard for deployment logs
4. **Docker Issues**: Verify Docker configurations and check container logs

## Best Practices

- **Use Docker for development** (`npm run docker:up`) to ensure environment consistency
- Always test changes locally before creating a PR
- Use descriptive PR titles that follow semantic versioning conventions
- Test workflows locally with `npm test` or individual workflow tests
- Monitor the GitHub Actions logs for any issues
- Keep dependencies up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities
- Use detached mode (`npm run docker:up:detach`) for background development
