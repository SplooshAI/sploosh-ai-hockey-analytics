# Feature Documentation

This folder contains detailed documentation for new features in the Sploosh.AI
Hockey Analytics project.

## Purpose

Document features to:

- Capture requirements and design decisions
- Explain implementation approach and rationale
- Provide usage examples and integration points
- Track feature evolution over time
- Help future engineers understand feature context

## When to Create Documentation

Create feature documentation when:

- The feature is substantial or has multiple components
- Design decisions were made that need explanation
- The feature introduces new patterns or approaches
- Integration points with other features are complex
- User-facing behavior needs to be documented

Small, self-explanatory features may not need dedicated documentation.

## What to Include

Use `/docs/TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point. Key sections:

- **Overview**: What does this feature do? Why was it built?
- **Requirements**: User stories, acceptance criteria
- **Design Decisions**: Key choices made and why
- **Implementation Details**: High-level architecture, key files
- **Test Coverage**: How the feature is tested
- **Usage Examples**: How to use the feature
- **Future Considerations**: Potential improvements or extensions

## File Naming

- `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`
- Example: `2026-01-15-analytics-event-tracking.md`
- Example: `2026-02-10-user-feedback-widget.md`

## Linking

Reference feature documentation from:

- Strategic planning documents
- PR descriptions
- User-facing documentation (README)
- Related architecture decisions
- Other feature documentation (for integrations)
