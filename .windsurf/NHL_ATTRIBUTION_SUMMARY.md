# NHL Copyright and Attribution Implementation

## Summary

Added comprehensive NHL copyright and trademark attribution to the application to properly credit the NHL and NHL EDGE data sources and clarify that we are not affiliated with or endorsed by the NHL.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: NHLAttribution

**File:** `/components/shared/nhl-attribution/nhl-attribution.tsx`

Created a reusable component with two display variants:

- **Sidebar variant**: Compact version for the sidebar footer with essential trademark and disclaimer information
- **Footer variant**: Full version for main content area with detailed attribution, data sources, and disclaimers

The component includes:

- NHL trademark notices (NHL, NHL Shield, NHL EDGE, Stanley Cup)
- Copyright notice with dynamic year
- Data attribution explaining the use of NHL EDGE APIs
- Clear disclaimer stating no affiliation with the NHL
- Proper formatting and styling for readability

### 2. Updated Layouts

**Files Modified:**

- `/components/layouts/sidebar/sidebar.tsx`
- `/components/layouts/main-layout.tsx`
- `/components/layouts/demo-layout.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added `NHLAttribution` component to sidebar footer (compact variant)
- Added `NHLAttribution` component to main content footer (full variant)
- Maintained consistent styling with existing design system
- Ensured proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### 3. Documentation Updates

**File:** `README.md`

Added new "NHL Data Attribution" section that includes:

- Statement of non-affiliation with the NHL
- Trademark acknowledgments
- Copyright notice
- Reference to attribution display in the application

## Legal Compliance

The implementation follows standard NHL attribution requirements based on:

1. **NHL Trademark Guidelines**: Proper acknowledgment of NHL, NHL Shield, NHL EDGE, and Stanley Cup trademarks
2. **Copyright Notice**: Dynamic year display with NHL copyright
3. **Data Source Attribution**: Clear statement that data comes from publicly available NHL APIs
4. **Disclaimer**: Explicit statement that the application is not affiliated with or endorsed by the NHL

## Display Locations

### Sidebar Footer

- Compact version with essential information
- Appears at the bottom of the sidebar below the version number
- Visible on all pages with sidebar navigation

### Main Content Footer

- Detailed version with full attribution
- Appears at the bottom of main content area
- Includes data attribution and comprehensive disclaimer
- Consistent across all layout variants (main and demo)

## Component Usage

```tsx
// Sidebar variant (compact)
<NHLAttribution variant="sidebar" />

// Footer variant (full)
<NHLAttribution variant="footer" />
```

## Benefits

1. **Legal Protection**: Proper attribution protects against potential trademark/copyright issues
2. **Transparency**: Clear communication to users about data sources
3. **Professionalism**: Demonstrates respect for NHL intellectual property
4. **Reusability**: Component can be easily updated if attribution requirements change
5. **Consistency**: Same attribution appears across all pages and layouts

## Future Considerations

- Monitor NHL's official attribution requirements for any updates
- Update copyright year automatically (already implemented)
- Consider adding links to NHL.com and NHL EDGE if beneficial
- May need to update if NHL releases official API documentation with specific attribution requirements
